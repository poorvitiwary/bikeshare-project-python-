###Overview

In this project, I will make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States—Chicago, New York City, 
and Washington. I have writen code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. 
I have also writen a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present 
these statistics.
This project is part of my Python Foundation Nanodegree.


###How to run the script

You can run the script using a Python integrated development environment (IDE) such as Spyder. To install Spyder, you will need to download the Anaconda installer.
This script is written in Python 3, so you will need the Python 3.x version of the installer. After downloading and installing Anaconda, you will find the Spyder 
IDE by opening Anaconda Navigator.


###Bike Share Data

Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent 
bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the 
same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.
Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. 
These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.
In this project, I have used data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. 
I have compared the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.


###The Datasets

Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:
Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:
Gender
Birth Year

Data for the first 10 rides in the new_york_city.csv file.


###The Files

I have answered to questions using Python, I have written a Python script. In bikeshare.py file, I have done all manipulations required. Also the three city dataset files are available for download in bikeshare project resources.
